# Ui — Style Reference
> clinical blueprint on frosted paper

**Theme:** light

shadcn/ui is a monochromatic design-system workshop: pure white canvas, soft warm-gray surfaces, and large-radius cards floating on hairline borders. The interface is almost entirely achromatic — black text, white surfaces, gray secondary tones — with a single destructive red reserved for error states and nothing else. Typography leans on Geist's geometric neutrality with tight letter-spacing on display sizes, creating a quiet, code-adjacent feel that reads as developer infrastructure rather than consumer product.
